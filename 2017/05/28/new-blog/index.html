      <p>Since I finished my undergraduate education, I needed to create a new blog. My last one was more focused on developing exploration and eye-candy than anything.</p>

<p>I'd like to focus on typography and readability for this update. This means writing, photos, and all other content will come first in the design process.</p>

<p>My next steps will be to experiment with the typography and sizing for a seemless reading experience. I want you to almost enjoy reading all of my posts not only for the value inside the post, but the reading form &amp; style itself as well.</p>

<p>xoxo</p>

<p>hello</p>
