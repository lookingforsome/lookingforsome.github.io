I just finished school and was hired as a temp employee until I am offered a full-time position (hopefully). I am finance analyst within a multinational company.

Since a lot of my work revolves around telling stories with data within Excel, I was used to using spreadsheets to track and organize different areas.

One day, I decided to make a personal spreadsheet for myself to track my spending and savings, especially since I'm being payed as a consultant.
